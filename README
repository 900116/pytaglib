A python (2.x/3.x) wrapper for my taglib fork providing a unified dictionary-based tag interface. Needs Cython to install.
Note that you need Cython built for python3.x if you want to use this library with python3.x. Unfortunatelly,
most of the linux distributions don't ship a python3-aware cython yet. Luckily, you can easily get one by typing 

sudo easy_install3 cython

into a console.

I guess you need at least Cython 0.15 for this package to compile, though I haven't tested this.



To install this library, first install the taglib-fork from http://github.com/supermihi/taglib. After that, 
the following two commands should suffice:

python3 setup.py build_ext
sudo python3 setup.py install

Replace "3" by whatever Python version you use.

Usage:
$ python3
Python 3.2.2rc1 (default, Aug 14 2011, 19:02:04) 
[GCC 4.6.1] on linux2

>>> import taglib
>>> f = taglib.File("x.ogg")
>>> f.tags
{'ALBUM': ['omgwtf', 'lol'], 'ARTIST': ['ein grÃ¼ner Affe']}
>>> f.length

>>> f.sampleRate

>>> f.tags["ARTIST"] = ["A new artist"]
>>> f.save()
